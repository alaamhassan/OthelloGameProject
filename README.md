# Min_Max_Algorithm for othello Game
##### This is an implementation of the Minimax algorithm for playing the game of Othello.
##### The Minimax algorithm is a recursive algorithm used to determine the optimal move in a game with multiple players, 
##### typically a two-player game.
## othello Game
##### Othello is a strategy board game played on an 8x8 board.
##### The goal of the game is to have the majority of your colored discs (either black or white) on the board at the end of the game.
##### Players take turns placing discs on the board, flipping their opponent's discs to their own color by trapping them between two of their own discs.
## MinMax Algorthim 
##### The Minimax algorithm evaluates the possible moves in the game by assigning a value to each game state. 
##### This value represents how favorable the state is for a given player. 
##### The algorithm recursively explores the game tree, considering both the current player's moves and the opponent's potential moves.
##### At each level of the tree, the algorithm alternates between maximizing the score (when it's the current player's turn) 
##### and minimizing the score (when it's the opponent's turn). By assuming that the opponent plays optimally, 
##### the algorithm selects the move that maximizes the minimum value of the resulting positions.
## implementation 
The implementation of the Minimax algorithm for Othello involves the following steps:

1) Generate all legal moves for the current player.
2) For each legal move, apply the move to the current game state and evaluate the resulting state using the position evaluation function.
3) Apply the Minimax algorithm recursively for each resulting game state, considering the opponent's moves.
4) At the terminal states (game over), return a value based on the outcome of the game (e.g., +1 for a win, -1 for a loss, 0 for a draw).
5) At each level of the tree, if it's the current player's turn, select the move with the maximum evaluated value. If it's the opponent's turn, select the move with the minimum evaluated value.
6) Return the best move found at the top level of the tree.

## conclusion 
The Minimax algorithm is a powerful technique for determining the optimal move in a game like Othello. By recursively exploring the game tree and considering the opponent's moves, it can find a move that maximizes the minimum value of the resulting positions.
